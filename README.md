Here you will see some of the most advanced ML methods in my portfolio.  All RMD/R files work with the wine.csv file in the directory.  All .R and .Rmd files are identical except for the comments have been removed.  

Included:

  Advanced Data Imputation: I synthesize missing data and use some advanced informative missing methods to prove that I will not shift my variation in test by 2%.  
  
  Clustering with DBSCAN: I use clusting to predict the cultivator that created the wine based on the the attributes.
  
  Tree:Forest:XG: Similar to the DBSCAN project above, I increment the complexity of a Decision Tree -> Random Forest-> XGBoost



Lexicon:
Cultivator: This term typically refers to the person or entity responsible for growing and cultivating the grapes used to produce wine. It can also refer to the specific grape variety.

Alcohol: Alcohol content is an important component of wine and is typically expressed as a percentage. It is produced through the fermentation process when yeast converts the sugars in grape juice into alcohol.

Malic Acid: Malic acid is a type of organic acid found in grapes and wine. It contributes to the overall acidity and tartness of the wine. During the winemaking process, malic acid can undergo a conversion to softer-tasting lactic acid through a process called malolactic fermentation.

Ash: Ash refers to the inorganic residue left behind after the complete combustion of organic matter. In wine analysis, ash content represents the mineral residue present in the wine, which includes various elements like potassium, calcium, magnesium, and others.

Alkalinity of Ash: Alkalinity of ash measures the basicity or acidity of the inorganic components found in wine ash. It is typically expressed in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) and can provide insights into the buffering capacity of the wine.

Magnesium: Magnesium is a mineral element that can be found in grapes and subsequently in wine. Its presence can influence the wine's sensory characteristics and may contribute to its overall flavor and mouthfeel.

Total Phenols: Total phenols represent the sum of all phenolic compounds present in wine, including flavonoids, tannins, and other compounds. These compounds contribute to the color, flavor, and antioxidant properties of the wine.

Flavanoids: Flavanoids are a subgroup of phenolic compounds found in wine. They are responsible for the wine's color, bitterness, and astringency. Examples of flavonoids include catechins, anthocyanins, and flavonols.

Nonflavanoid Phenols: Nonflavanoid phenols are another subgroup of phenolic compounds found in wine. They include compounds such as resveratrol and hydroxycinnamic acids. These compounds contribute to the wine's sensory attributes and also possess potential health benefits.

Proanthocyanins: Proanthocyanins are a specific type of flavonoid found in red wines. They contribute to the wine's color, mouthfeel, and astringency. Proanthocyanins are polymerized flavonoids that can form complex structures known as tannins.

Color Intensity: Color intensity refers to the depth and concentration of color in a wine, particularly in red wines. It is influenced by the presence of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the red, purple, or blue hues in the wine.

Hue: Hue is a visual descriptor of the color of wine and is typically expressed in degrees. It refers to the dominant color observed when looking at the wine, such as red, purple, or yellow.

NOD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines: NOD280/OD315 is a ratio used to measure the absorbance of light at specific wavelengths (280 nm and 315 nm) in diluted wine samples. This ratio can provide information about the protein content and stability of the wine.

Proline: Proline is an amino acid found in grapes and subsequently in wine. It can contribute to the wine's taste and mouthfeel. Proline levels in wine can vary depending on grape variety, ripeness, and winemaking techniques.
